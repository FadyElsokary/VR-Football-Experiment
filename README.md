# VR-Football-Experiment
This repository showcases a virtual reality (VR) football game experiment focused on penalty kicks. Participants will have the unique opportunity to experience the game from both a first-person and third-person perspective, embodying either themselves or a self-like avatar of the famous football player Mohamed Salah.
