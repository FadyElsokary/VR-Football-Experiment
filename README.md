# VR-Football-Experiment
This repository showcases a virtual reality (VR) football game experiment focused on penalty kicks. Participants will have the unique opportunity to experience the game from both a first-person and third-person perspective, embodying either themselves or a self-like avatar of the famous football player Mohamed Salah.
The experiment begins with an introductory scene where participants observe either themselves or the self-like avatar showcasing soccer skills and dribbling on a soccer field. However, the scene takes an unexpected turn when the avatar is fouled significantly within the penalty area. The referee promptly awards a clear penalty, and the avatar expertly converts it into a goal. Following this successful penalty kick, the avatar proceeds to celebrate, creating an immersive and engaging experience.

The primary focus of this experiment is on shooting penalty kicks. Participants will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the penalty kick process, including aiming, timing, and power control. They will then be given ten attempts to score against a goalkeeper, using their own skills or channeling the prowess of the self-like avatar. The number of successful goals achieved by participants will be recorded and analyzed, providing valuable insights into their shooting proficiency. Additionally, the velocity of the kicks will be measured and analyzed to assess the impact of power control on goal-scoring success.

The repository contains the necessary Unity project files, C# scripts, and assets used to create the VR football penalty kick experiment. It also includes documentation on the experiment design, methodology, and data analysis procedures. Researchers, developers, and VR enthusiasts can explore the codebase, replicate the experiment, and adapt it to their own projects or research studies.

By providing an immersive and interactive VR experience focused on penalty kicks, this experiment aims to contribute to the understanding of shooting proficiency and its relation to power control. The insights gained from this experiment could have implications for training methodologies, player performance assessment, and the development of realistic virtual football experiences.
